## 🧩 Issue Guidelines

### 🔹 Issue Assignment
- A contributor can be assigned **a maximum of 3 issues at a time**
- Contributors must work **only on already created issues**
- Do not start working on an issue unless it is **assigned to you**

### 🔹 Creating Issues
- **Very beginner contributors** may create issues related to:
  - Bugs
  - UI/UX issues
  - Documentation improvements
- Feature requests or major changes must be **discussed with the project admin** before creating an issue
- Issues should include:
  - A clear and descriptive title
  - Detailed explanation
  - Steps to reproduce (for bugs), if applicable

---

## 🔁 Pull Request (PR) Guidelines
- Every PR must be linked to an **assigned issue**
- Follow the project’s coding standards and folder structure
- Keep PRs focused — **one issue per PR**
- Add screenshots or screen recordings for UI-related changes
- Use clear and meaningful commit messages

---

## ⏳ Inactivity Policy
- If a contributor **does not respond or provide updates within 3 days** on an assigned issue or PR:
  - The issue may be reassigned to another contributor
  - The PR may be closed due to inactivity
- If more time is needed, comment on the issue or PR to avoid reassignment

---

## 🧠 Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Spam PRs or plagiarized/copied code will be **closed immediately**
- The project admin’s decision will be **final** in case of conflicts

---
